# Music Player in JavaScript

It's time to create a real music player in JavaScript. With everything we have learned so far, this will be a good challenge for you.

<br>
<div style="margin: auto; width: 200px;">
  <img src="./assets/inspiration_screenshot.png">
</div>
<br>

By using the `<audio>` tag in JavaScript we get a working music player out of the box that is fully equipped with everything we need in order to make shrimp paste of this exercise!

To you help you have these resources:

- [w3shools `<audio>` tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_audio.asp)
- [w3schools `<audio>` DOM reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_av_dom.asp)
- [`<audio>`: The Embed Audio element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio#usage_notes)
- [Jamendo Music](https://www.jamendo.com/start) - Free download of independent music, needs account but it's free.

In the assets folder you already have access to six random rock songs and their album cover. If you want other songs, you are free to add them on your own. Use the [Jamendo Music](https://www.jamendo.com/start) webpage or from another source.
